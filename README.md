# Deep Learning based Inter-Modality Image Registration Supervised by Intra-Modality Similarity

 The aim of the project is to reveal the geometric accuracy of tomography images and the soft tissue resolution quality of  MRI images with deep learning-based image registration method.

## Principles of Radiography

  Radiology is the use of x-rays and other imaging methods in medicine for diagnosis and treatment.

### COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ( CT )

  By taking many two-dimensional X-ray images of an object from different angles, it is tried to obtain a three-dimensional image of the internal structure of that object.
  +    Creates a detailed and layered picture by scanning the   relevant area or areas of the body with X-r
  +    Gives the closest results geometrically.
  +    Helpful in applications such as drug dosage for disease treatment.

###  MAGNETIC RESONANCE ( MRI )

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues in the body 

 +   High-resolution images of the inside of the body are obtained to diagnose      various problems. 
 +   Most widely used method for disease diagnosis.
